<h1>Privacy Policy – RiExpense</h1>
<div class="small">Last updated: August 13, 2025</div>

<div class="box">
<p>RiExpense (“the App”) helps you record income and expenses on your Android device. This policy explains what information is processed, how it’s used, and your choices. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>
</div>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No account, no server.</strong> Your entries are stored locally on your device using a local database.</li>
  <li><strong>Optional backup &amp; export.</strong> You can back up/restore to a file you choose (e.g., Google Drive via Android’s file picker) and export to Excel. These files are created only where <em>you</em> select.</li>
  <li><strong>Ads.</strong> The free version uses Google AdMob to show ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers and other information to show and measure ads.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information We Handle</h2>
<p><strong>App data you enter:</strong> amounts, categories, notes and dates you save in the App. This data stays on your device unless you back it up or export it. The developer does not receive this data.</p>

<h3>Advertising data (AdMob)</h3>
<p>The App uses Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). Google may collect and process information such as device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID), approximate location derived from IP, app interactions (e.g., ad impressions/clicks), and diagnostic information to deliver and measure ads. Google is an independent controller of this data. Learn more in Google’s policies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
  <li>AdMob &amp; data: <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>How Features Work</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> Entries are stored in a local database on your device.</li>
  <li><strong>Excel export:</strong> When you export, an <code>.xlsx</code> file is written to the location you choose using Android’s “Save as” dialog.</li>
  <li><strong>Backup &amp; restore:</strong> The App creates/reads a JSON backup file to/from a location you choose (including Google Drive via the Android file picker). The file is not sent to the developer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Permissions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>INTERNET</code> and <code>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</code> – required for loading ads (AdMob) and connectivity checks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Edit/Delete:</strong> You can edit or delete entries at any time from within the App.</li>
  <li><strong>Back up/Export:</strong> You can create your own backup or Excel export to keep or share your data.</li>
  <li><strong>Ads personalization:</strong> You can limit or reset your Android Advertising ID and turn off “Ads personalization” in device settings. You can also manage ad choices at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adssettings.google.com</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is not directed to children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child has used the App and provided information, please contact us and we will assist.</p>

<h2>Security &amp; Retention</h2>
<p>Your data is stored locally on your device. We recommend using a device screen lock and regular backups. Backup and export files are not encrypted by default; store them securely. The developer does not keep your personal data on a server.</p>

<h2>International Transfers</h2>
<p>AdMob is provided by Google LLC and its affiliates. Ad-related data may be processed on servers outside your country. See Google’s Privacy Policy for details.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. Updates will be posted here with a new “Last updated” date.</p>
